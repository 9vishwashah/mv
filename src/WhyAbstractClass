The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects

* To access the abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. *

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods
